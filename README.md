Specification
-------------

### Technologies Used

Badgeyay uses a number of open source projects:

* [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - Microframework powered by python
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - Responsive frontend framework
* [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) - Script used for merging badges of different types
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Webapp deployed here
* [Travis](travis-ci.org) - Continuous Integration of the project
* [Github Release](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) - Releases are GitHub's way of packaging and providing software to the users

### Testing Methodology Used

* [Python Unit tests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - for assertion, with the help of [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/Selenium) for web browser automation.

The guidelines for setting up and running the tests are mentioned in the [testing docs](docs/test/testing.md).

### Input

- The input is a set of csv files in the same folder, UTF-8.
- The csv file is named after the badge type to take. Example: `vip.png.csv` uses the picture `vip.png`.
- The CSV has up to 4 columns for the name and the twitter handle. They will be filled if this number is filled:
  - `__X_`
  - `__XX`
  - `_XXX`
  - `XXXX`
- Optional configuration file in json format to customise badges.
- A sample configuration file is shown below
  ```
  {
    "options": {
        "badge_wrap": true,
        "paper_size_format": "A3"
    }
  }
  ```

  - badge_wrap: It can be **true** or **false**. If set to true then for each entry in the csv file two badges
                will be generated so that they can be wrapped around the badge card.
  - paper_size_format: As of now it's value can be either **"A3"** or **"A4"**. The value will decide the size
                       of the page on which the badges (in groups of 8) will be printed. Not required if width
                       and height of parameters are explicitly mentioned.
  - width: Width of the page on which badges (in groups of 8) will be printed. Value should be in mm.
           For example: **"297mm"**
  - height: Height of the page on which badges (in groups of 8) will be printed. Value should be in mm.
            For example: **"420mm"**.

### Output

The output file is svg / pdf / multipage pdf of size A3.
Each badge has the size A6.
The outputs are in a folder derived from the input csv.
The outputs can be either of the two types, viz ZIPs or PDFs, or both. User has the choice to choose from either of the two or from both of them.

### Customization

You can change the font style, font size, color etc from the `.svg` file in the folder badges.
Inkscape is generally used for editing of such files.

### Usage

You need Ubuntu to run the application. Check out the [User Input Guide](https://badge-maker.herokuapp.com/guide) for more details.
